\title{Get population estimates}
\usage{
get_pop_est(
  level = c("datazone", "intzone", "hscp", "ca", "hb"),
  version = "latest",
  min_year = NULL,
  max_year = NULL,
  age_groups = FALSE,
  pivot_wider = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{level}{The geographic level for which to retrieve population estimates.
One of "datazone", "intzone", "hscp", "ca", or "hb".}

\item{version}{The version of the population estimates to use (default: "latest").}

\item{min_year, max_year}{(optional) The minimum and maximum years to include in the results.}

\item{age_groups}{Logical, indicating whether to aggregate population estimates by age groups.
If \code{TRUE}, the \code{phsmethods::create_age_groups} function is used.}

\item{pivot_wider}{Optionally reshape the data into a wider format, summarising population counts by the specified columns.
Allowed values:
\itemize{
\item \code{FALSE} (default): Do not pivot.
\item \code{TRUE} or \code{"all"}: Pivot by both sex and age/age group.
\item \code{"age"}: Pivot by age/age group only.
\item \code{"age-only"}: Pivot by age/age group and aggregate to remove sex.
\item \code{"sex"}: Pivot by sex only.
\item \code{"sex-only"}: Pivot by sex group and aggregate to remove age/age group
}}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link[phsmethods:create_age_groups]{phsmethods::create_age_groups()}}.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the filtered and possibly transformed population data.
}
\description{
This function retrieves population estimates based on various parameters.
It reads population data from a specified file and filters it based on the
input parameters. The function also allows for grouping by age and pivoting
the data for wider format.
}
\note{
Depending on the values for \code{age_groups} and \code{pivot_wider}, the resulting
columns in the returned tibble will vary. Refer to the examples below for
illustration.

\examples{
# Basic Usage: Datazone Population Estimates (no filtering)
get_pop_est("datazone")

# Filter by Year:
get_pop_est("ca", min_year = 1995, max_year = 2020)

# Age Groups: Health Board (HB) Population Estimates by Age Group
get_pop_est("hb", age_groups = TRUE)

# Age Groups with Custom Settings:
# Aggregate into 5-year age groups, with an open-ended final group "85+"
get_pop_est("hb", age_groups = TRUE, by = 5, to = 85)

# Pivot Wider (All): CA Population Estimates, Reshaped by Sex and Age Group
# The result will have columns for each combination of sex and age group,
# e.g., "pop_f_0_4", "pop_m_5_9", etc.
get_pop_est("ca", age_groups = TRUE, pivot_wider = "all")

# Pivot Wider (Age Only): CA Population Estimates, Reshaped by Age Group Only
# This is useful if you only need the total population for each age group, regardless of sex.
get_pop_est("ca", age_groups = TRUE, pivot_wider = "age-only")

# Combined Filtering, Age Groups, and Pivoting:
# CA population from 2015-2020, aggregated by 10-year age groups, and pivoted by sex
# The result will have columns for each sex ("pop_f", "pop_m") and a row per age group.
get_pop_est("ca", min_year = 2015, max_year = 2020, age_groups = TRUE, by = 10, pivot_wider = "sex")
